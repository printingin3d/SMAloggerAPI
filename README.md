# SMAloggerAPI
A Java API to read data from SMA devices, based on the SBFspot project

This is a Java library version of the <a href="https://github.com/Harrum/SMAloggerAPI">SMAloggerAPI project<a>
which is a redesigned version of the <a href="https://github.com/Harrum/SMAlogger">SMAlogger project</a> 
which was a direct translation of the <a href="https://sbfspot.codeplex.com/">SBFspot project</a>.

The goal of this project is to make the original project an easy to use Java Maven library.

# Usage
to be added

Note: Multiple inverters should be supported but I have no way of testing this, so I don't know yet if this 
functionality works.

Major props to the creators of the original SBFspot project.
